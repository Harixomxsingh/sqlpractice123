## SQL Usage

with the help of CRUD operations, performing CRUD operations is the most common task when working with the database

### CRUD Operations
- Create - add or insert data
- Read - read data
- Update - Update existing data
- Delete - delete data

along side with this operation SQL can do many operation it can be divided into many subsection or sub languages

### SQL subsets
- DDL - Data Definition language
- DML - Data Manipulation language
- DQL - Data query language
- DCL - Data Control Language

### DDL - Data Definition language
used to create storage objects in a database, like table


DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL that is used to create, modify, and delete database objects. These objects can include tables, views, indexes, sequences, and users. DDL commands are typically used by database administrators to create and maintain the database schema.

Here are some examples of DDL commands:

- CREATE: Creates a new database object, such as a table or view.
- ALTER: Modifies an existing database object.
- DROP: Deletes an existing database object.
- TRUNCATE: Deletes all of the data from a table, but preserves the table structure.
- RENAME: Renames a database object.

### DML - Data Manipulation language

DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is a subset of SQL that is used to manipulate data in a database. This includes inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data. DML commands are typically used by developers and database administrators to manage the data in a database.

Here are some examples of DML commands:

- INSERT: Inserts a new record into a table.
- UPDATE: Updates an existing record in a table.
- DELETE: Deletes a record from a table.
- SELECT: Queries the data in a table.

### DQL - Data query language

DQL stands for Data Query Language. It is a subset of SQL that is used to query and retrieve data from a database. DQL commands are typically used by developers and database administrators to analyze data and generate reports.

The most common DQL command is the SELECT statement. The SELECT statement allows you to specify which columns you want to retrieve from a table, and to filter the results based on specific criteria. You can also use the SELECT statement to perform calculations on the data, and to group and sort the results.

### DCL - Data Control Language 

DCL stands for Data Control Language. It is a subset of SQL that is used to grant, revoke, and manage user permissions on a database. DCL commands are typically used by database administrators to control who has access to the database and what they can do with the data.

Here are some examples of DCL commands:

- GRANT: Grants permissions to a user on a database object.
- REVOKE: Revokes permissions from a user on a database object.
- CREATE USER: Creates a new user in the database.
- ALTER USER: Modifies an existing user in the database.
- DROP USER: Deletes a user from the database.
